# Guessing-Game-Challenge
This is a simple Python-based Guessing Number Game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback after each guess to help the user determine how close their guess is to the correct number. The feedback ranges from "Cold" for guesses far off, to "Warm" for guesses that are close.

**How to Play**

Choose a Difficulty Level: Select from Easy, Medium, or Hard. Each level adjusts the guessing range and the number of attempts allowed.
Make Your Guesses: Enter your guesses and receive instant feedback. The game will let you know if youâ€™re "Cold," "Cool," "Warm," or "Very Warm" based on how close your guess is.
Win or Lose: If you guess the correct number within the allowed attempts, you win! If you run out of guesses, the correct number is revealed.

**Features**

Multiple difficulty levels to challenge users of all skill levels.
Immediate feedback on the proximity of your guesses.
Input validation to ensure smooth gameplay.

This project is a great example of basic Python programming, utilizing loops, conditionals, and exception handling, making it perfect for those who are learning or want to demonstrate their Python skills.
